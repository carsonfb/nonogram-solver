===============

This program solves nonogram puzzles.  Nonograms are a type of logic puzzle wherein a list of
numbers are give for each row and column signifying which cells of a grid to fill in and which to
leave blank.

Installation
------------
1. Ensure that you have Python installed.  This was developed under version 3.8.10, but many other
versions of 3 should also work.  Additionally, there should not need to be many changes to get it
to work under Python 2.x if, for some reason, that is all you have available to you.

2. Clone the repository onto your computer.

3. Optional, but recommended:  Setup a virtual environment for the project.

4. Install the dependencies with the command *pip install -r requirements.txt*.

Or, optionally, if there is a pre-compiled version for your system, you can download that if you
are not interested in the source code.
